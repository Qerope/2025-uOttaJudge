Welcome to **uOttaJudge**. üéâ

**Before proceeding, kindly review this important message.** üìù

uOttaJudge is an automated expo judging system designed to guide you through the judging process while collecting your votes seamlessly. ü§ñ

The system operates on a pairwise comparison model. You'll begin by reviewing a single submission. Subsequently, for each new submission, you'll determine whether it surpasses or falls short of the previous one **without delay**. üîÑ

Should you encounter difficulty locating a specific submission, utilize the 'Skip' button for reassignment. **Avoid skipping unless absolutely necessary**. ‚ö†Ô∏è

Submitting votes via uOttaJudge is straightforward, yet it's crucial to deliberate before casting your vote. **Once a decision is made, it cannot be reversed**. ‚è≥
